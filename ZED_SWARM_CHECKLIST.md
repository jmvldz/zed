- Update history to store Claude Code sessions or Codex sessions

So Zed is building support for loading session history with Claude Code and Codex but what that is, is a wrapper around the Claude Code SDK in the form of claude-code-acp. They didn't actually work directly with Anthropic, they just used the existing SDK.

Same for codex in codex-acp.
